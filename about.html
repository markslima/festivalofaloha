	<h2 class="artist">Carole Lanialoha Lee-Sumberg</h2>
	<img class="profile" src="images/aboutuslani.png" height="317" width="202" alt="Lani Aloha">
	<p class="bio">Lanialoha Lee, a native Hawaiian born and raised in the Chicago area, and, third
	generation descendant of the first Polynesians who migrated to the Midwest.</p>
	<p class="bio">My Grandmother, understanding the dearth of Pacific Island cultural and
	musical resources available in the Midwest, left Hawai`i and came to live with
	our family in Buffalo Grove to ensure the knowledge of our culture, hula, and
	music was not lost in our generation.</p>
	<p class="bio">She structured my lessons of Hawaiiana in the ‘old way’ — spending an
	initial fifteen years instilling Hawaiian values within me, before passing on her
	knowledge she accumulated over a lifetime, to me, through oral traditions.</p>
	<p class="bio">I simultaneously pursued academic music studies at Buffalo Grove High
	School, VanderCook College and the University of Southern Colorado, toward
	a music education degree.</p>
	<p class="bio">After completing my academic studies, I pursued studies with master teachers
	of other pacific island cultural arts with an emphasis on repertoire. I toured as
	a performing artist in the venues these master teachers performed in, earning
	their respect and a place as their student.</p>
	<p class="bio">My continuing work as a professional performing artist in forms of music and dance encompassed chanting, vocal
	work, instrumentation characteristic to both Western and Pacific Island cultural arts, and education.</p>
	<p class="bio">It was ultimately the `ukulele that proved to best serve my musical mission of realigning the Western world’s perception
	of Pacific Island music. I’ve traveled nationally and internationally, educating audiences at `ukulele festivals, workshops,
	and concert performances. My work as an artist and advocate for the Pacific Island arts has been featured on NPR,
	WBEZ, Solid POI Radio, the Chicago Tribune, the Chicago Reader, Where Magazine, CAN TV, WTTW, KOCH-TV, and
	Chicago’s local broadcasting stations.</p>
	<p class="bio">Throughout my sixteen year residence at the Old Town School of Folk Music, I’ve taught hundreds of `ukulele
	students, refining my curriculum and cultivating a new generation of musicians with a refined sensitivity to the culture
	bridging the Midwest to the islands through shared repertoire.</p>
	<p class="bio">I continue to perform and teach, hopeful that an appreciation will develop and augment the cultural literacy of those
	unfamiliar with Pacific Island repertoire.</p>
	
	<h2 class="artist">Daniel Ho</h2>
	<img class="profile" src="images/aboutusdanho.png" height="203" width="136">
	</br>
	<p class="bio">From his simple beginnings in Honolulu to his life amid the hustle and bustle of Los Angeles,
	Daniel Ho has worked over the years as a musician, producer, singer/songwriter, arranger,
	composer, engineer, and record company owner. The most compelling of these roles has
	been as a six-time GRAMMY Award winning producer, featured slack key guitarist, and artist
	in the "Best Hawaiian Music Album" category.
	Daniel’s musical inclinations were apparent at an early age. His first instruments were organ
	and `ukulele, from which he graduated to classical guitar, piano, electric guitar, bass, drums,
	and eventually, voice. His passion for music led him to study composing, arranging and film
	scoring at the Grove School of Music in Los Angeles. He began his professional career as
	the leader, keyboardist, composer, and producer for Kilauea, a contemporary jazz group he
	formed in 1990. By 1997, Kilauea had released six chart-topping albums, two of which hit the Top 10 on Billboard’s
	jazz charts. As momentum of the smooth-jazz genre waned, Daniel set his sights on starting an independent record
	label. His interests in photography and graphic design complimented the requisite responsibilities of marketing and
	production. In 1998, he launched Daniel Ho Creations. Slowly, the releases grew into collaborative projects that featured
	himeni (Hawaiian hymnody), hula, `ukulele, and slack key guitar.</p>
	
	<p class="bio">To date, Daniel Ho Creations has released over eighty acoustic and Hawaiian-themed CDs by many of Hawai`i’s most
	respected artists, who are first and foremost friends. Daniel has received numerous Hawaiian music industry accolades
	including three Na Hoku Hanohano awards and fifteen Hawai`i Music Awards. In recent years, Daniel has been able
	to remain true to his craft and focus on what he loves most: the music. He is an accomplished singer and songwriter
	who has shared his music as a soloist throughout the U.S., Japan, Europe, Guam, and even Tasmania. He has been
	featured with the Honolulu Symphony; toured as a keyboardist and guitarist for GRAMMY Award-winning vocalist,
	Peabo Bryson; guest-lectured at Stanford University; and authored or co-authored nine music books. On a behind-thesilver-
	screen note, he performed the Hawaiian-language cover of Prince’s “Nothing Compares 2 U” which can be heard
	during the end credits of the 2008 feature film, “Forgetting Sarah Marshall”. Daniel is a YAMAHA guitar artist and plays
	KoAloha `ukuleles.</p>

	She conveys a moving and mesmerizing style that is all her own, influenced by the
	late-greats, who include Lena Machado and Genoa Keawe. She is a mainstay performer
	at the Merrie Monarch Festivals, has represented the Big Island of Hawai'i at venerable
	Hawaiian events in Japan, and has travelled across the United States and enchanted
	audiences with her uplifting personality and genuine sense of aloha.</p>

Jason has performed across the U.S. including the Bean Blossom Blues Festival in Indiana and the world famous Viper Room in Hollywood, California as well as internationally at the Cairns Ukulele Festival in Australia.</p>
