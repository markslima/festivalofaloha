				<p style="color: RGB(231,232,233);">The Old Town School is home to the only Pacific Islands culture and arts program of its kind in the United States, led by instructor, performing artist and
			Kumu Hula Lanialoha Lee. Since 1997, Lee has built
			a program of more than 100 students each eight-week
			session, crossing education and instrument
			genres and departments, and ranging in ages from
			infants to adults. Lee has also worked closely with our
			performance and community outreach departments
			to ensure that nationally and internationally touring
			performers and educators from all Pacific Island
			cultures are represented in our seasons of field trips,
			concerts, and events.</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>Kanikapila</b></p>
			<p>Truly embodying the “teach and celebrate” mission of
			the Old Town School, Kanikapila is a party, a gathering,
			and a jam session with music, dance and Pacific Island
			style food in a potluck style. Each session of classes
			culminates in this celebration, and we hold other
			Kanikapilas as we can throughout the year, including
			as a part of the Chicago Folk and Roots Festival.</p>
