			<h2>Colorful Sounds</h2>
			<p>Presenter: Daniel Ho</p>
			<p>Recommended for Intermediate and Advanced levels</p>
			<h2>SUNDAY, MAY 27, 11:00AM-1:00PM</h2>
		
			<p class="description">Creative Harmony Made Simple. This is a more practical way of thinking about harmonic structure. Daniel Ho manages to “re-imagine
			tools” made easier for the student to grasp and apply. “This method focuses on module’s (group of notes) with uniform intervallic
			relationships and how they are used to build more complex harmonies.” <em>Colorful Sounds</em> is the result of 20 years of writing compositions,
			arrangements and performances. It is a ‘Harmonic Method’ that offers a “unique perspective” in one’s own musical creations. Students
			need a fundamental understanding of music theory to benefit from this material.</p>

			<h2>Open-String Fingerstyle Method for Guitar – A Beginner’s Guide</h2>

			makes mastering the basic concept of open-string technique enjoyable for students of any age and musical ability. 
			Daniel’s enthusiasm	for his craft and ability to adjust lessons and exercises to both beginners and seasoned players makes  it easy to start at any level whether that be learning the parts of the guitar or jumping into the exercises with a new, open-string approach.</p>
			
			<p class="description">Daniel’s knowledge of guitar along with his abilities as an artist and producer combine to make these lessons not only achievable, but enjoyable. 
			He teaches you the basics and then gently pushes you forward by using competitive chord exercises, necessary in grasping the fingering technique. 
			As a beginner guitar player myself, this book has taught me, with one finger on my left hand, how to start playing
			the guitar. Enjoy!”</p>

			<h2>The G Kilauea Tuning, A New Musical Voice</h2>
			<p>Presenter: Daniel Ho</p>
			<p>Recommended for Intermediate and Advanced Slack Key Guitar players</p>
			<h2>SATURDAY, MAY 26, 9:00-10:30AM</h2>
			
			<p class="description">“It was only a decade ago and I remember it vaguely. I was on a month-long U.S. tour playing keyboards in the pit orchestra of a
			theatrical show. It was a circus, both literally and figuratively. As an artist, I was transitioning from one genre to another – contemporary
			jazz to Hawaiian – from keyboards to guitar. I was balancing my personal and financial responsibilities against my elusive quest for a new
			musical voice. With my travel guitar in hand, I searched and searched-on the tour bus, waiting at the airport, in the hotel room, at sound
			check. I can’t remember if it was on the 10-hour bus ride to Schenectady, or in a Cincinnati hotel room when it came to me, but I am
			ever so grateful it did. In recognition of the contemporary jazz band that I toured and recorded with for the prior six years, I named my
			discovery the G Kilauea tuning.</p>
			
			<p class="description">I have been using this tuning since 1998 for almost all my fingerstyle guitar playing. I have experimented with other tunings, but found
			the <em>G Kilauea</em> tuning to be the most versatile and functional for solo instrumentalist and vocal accompaniment.”</p>

			constructed, how to play your instrument more musically, and how to connect with music at a deeper level. Learn to write and play your
			own music, figure out that song without buying the sheet music, and learn to improvise”. <em>Got It!</em> Is a method based on carefully selected
			essential lessons that empower students to bring life to their own musical vision.</p>
